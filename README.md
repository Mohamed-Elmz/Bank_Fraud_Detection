# Explainable and Fairness Driven Approach to Fraudulent Bank Account Detection

In today's financial sector, fraud detection methods that depend on machine learning are viewed as unreliable due to their hidden or black-box nature. As a result, financial institutions continue to rely on conventional practices such as flagging abnormal account activities and unusual account holder information to detect fraud. While these detection methods accurately identify known fraud patterns, they are more susceptible to complex and relatively new fraud tactics. The constant emergence of new fraud practices creates an urgency to capitalize on the unique pattern recognition capabilities of machine learning models, especially when the proper steps are employed to verify and explain their predictions. The following repository provides a practical example of an accurate and transparent machine learning approach to detecting fraudulent bank accounts.
