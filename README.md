# Explainable and Fairness Driven Approach to Fraudulent Bank Account Detection

A financial crime prevention company named FeedzAi has recently released an anonymized bank account data set known as BAF(Bank Account Fraud) that ensures a specified level of privacy while maintaining utility. Our plan is to capitalize on this unique data and develop a state of the art deep neural network model that can detect fraudulent bank accounts with transparency and reliability.

We propose to conduct a complete predictive analysis project to detect fraudulent bank accounts through binary classification. Our aims include:

1) Creating a model on par with the state of the art, and providing accurate results supported by robust and reliable prediction intervals. 
2) Examining model-level attribute importance and generating explainable insights from individual predictions, including misclassified samples.
3) Performing a model fairness assessment to strengthen the confidence in our predictions.
