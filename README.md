# Explainable and Fairness Driven Approach to Fraudulent Bank Account Detection
> The final written report *"Explainable and Fairness Driven Approach to Fraudulent Bank Account Detection"* describing our motivation, methods, and results is available [here](Final_Report.pdf).

## Project Background

In today's financial sector, fraud detection methods that depend on machine learning are viewed as unreliable due to their hidden or black-box nature. As a result, financial institutions continue to rely on conventional practices such as flagging abnormal account activities and unusual account holder information to detect fraud. While these detection methods accurately identify known fraud patterns, they are more susceptible to complex and relatively new fraud tactics. The constant emergence of new fraud practices creates an urgency to capitalize on the unique pattern recognition capabilities of machine learning models, especially when the proper steps are employed to verify and explain their predictions. The following repository provides a practical example of an accurate and transparent machine learning approach to detecting fraudulent bank accounts.

## About Our Data 

A financial crime prevention company, FeedzAI, collaborated with researchers from the University of Porto in Portugal to developed a new type of bank fraud data know as the [Bank Account Fraud](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sgpjesus/bank-account-fraud-dataset-neurips-2022) (BAF) data set. BAF applies differential privacy techniques to real-world banking data inorder to obfuscate sensitive information while preserving the meaning of attributes, an uncommon, yet vital characteristic of fraud data sets. This unique type of fraud data presents an opportunity to develop an accurate and explainable machine learning model.
